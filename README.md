# odin-recipes

This project is to create a website that holds recipes to make great food!

Used basic html to create a basic yet functional site. Will come back to this after I learn CSS!

Applied all the css ive learned up to this point. This is probably not good design for the website or code but all i can do with my current knowledge. Hope to come back and make it even better!.
